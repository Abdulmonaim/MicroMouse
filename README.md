# MicroMouse

## Overview

Welcome to the MicroMouse Maze Solver project, a championship-winning robot designed to navigate mazes and find the shortest path from start to finish. This robot secured 1st place in the IEEE Undergrads Competition (2019) by employing a Flood Fill algorithm for efficient maze-solving. The robot received a prize of 15000 LE.

## Features

- **Maze Navigation:** Autonomous maze navigation using a Flood Fill algorithm.
- **Flood Fill Algorithm:** Efficiently determines the shortest path from the start to finish.
- **Motor Control:** Precise control over motors for accurate movement.
- **Sensor Integration:** Interacts with sensors to detect obstacles and make informed decisions.
- **Memory Management:** Efficient memory handling for storing maze information.
